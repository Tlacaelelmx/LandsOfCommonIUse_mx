# LandsOfCommonIUse_mx


The (Mexico) National Agrarian Registry (RAN) updated this year the geographic data of the lands of common use (normally named Ejido), by state. However, the data presented 4,238 errors (all intersections), of the 32 databases, corresponding to each federative entity, only the CDMX had no errors in its files.

I corrected all these errors and merged the 32 databases into a single geographic file. RAN doesn't provide the names of the states or municipalities to which each common land belongs, I also added this information, their names (UTF-9) and five-digit municipal code (SSMMM) for eah common land.
